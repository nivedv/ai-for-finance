# Financial Velocity: Operationalizing M365 Copilot for Finance

> **"AI will not replace Finance Professionals. But Finance Professionals who use AI will replace those who don't."**

## 📋 Overview
Welcome to the official repository for the **Financial Velocity** training program. 

This curriculum is designed for high-performance finance teams (FP&A, Audit, Tax, Treasury) moving from legacy manual workflows to AI-augmented operations. The materials hosted here are not generic "chat" examples; they are operationalized labs designed to simulate real-world financial friction points—messy ledgers, audit risks, and complex variance analysis.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **Force Multiplier** for your daily work, enabling you to shift focus from "Data Processing" to "Data Architecture."

## ⚠️ Important Usage Notes

1.  **The "Table" Rule:** Copilot in Excel **only** works on formatted Tables. You must select your data and press `Ctrl + T` before attempting any prompt.
2.  **Data Privacy:** The datasets provided here are **synthetic**. They contain no real PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or proprietary financial data.
3.  **Verification:** Copilot is a reasoning engine, not a calculator. Always spot-check formulas and totals on a sample set before trusting the output.
